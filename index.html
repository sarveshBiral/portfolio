            <dd>Student Admission Management
This business case aims to improve the process of student admissions by creating a centralized system. It streamlines the process, reduces human error, and improves the efficiency of handling student applications. This system ensures that students are admitted in a transparent and systematic way, aligning with SDG 4 (Quality Education), by facilitating equitable access to educational opportunities.

Target 4.3: Ensure equal access for all women and men to affordable and quality technical, vocational, and tertiary education, including university education.

Impact: By automating admission processes, the system reduces the complexity for both students and administrators, making it easier for students from all backgrounds to access educational institutions.
Students Performance Tracking
Tracking student performance through automated systems enables educators to assess the learning progress of each student. By identifying struggling students early, institutions can provide targeted interventions and improve learning outcomes, directly supporting SDG 4 (Quality Education).

Target 4.1: Ensure that all youth and a substantial proportion of adults, both men and women, achieve literacy and numeracy.

Impact: This business case allows for a data-driven approach to improving student performance, enabling a more personalized educational experience.</dd>
